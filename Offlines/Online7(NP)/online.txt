HCP input -> G(V,E)

HCP In -> f -> TSP in

f: G - > G'(V,E') 
for all (u,v) not in E, (u,v) = inf in E'


Solve TSP problem.

get solution K

TSP out -> g -> HCP out
g : K-> (0,1)
if (K<inf) -> 1
else 0

HCP <= k TSP

TSP at least as hard as HCP
HCP = NP complete
so TSP = NP Hard

TSP is NP is trivial, 
Given sequence of vertices promised Yes answer, Check if SUM of corresponding edges < K
(done)



if TSP of length K(K<inf), then there is HCP. Trivial, by definition
No TSP of finite length, no HCP.
